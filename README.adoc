= Light Matter Coding Cheat Sheet

Light Matter Coding is principles, practices and a general style to write clear and understandable code. It's direct counterpart is dark matter coding that results in obscure code full of hidden traps that you can't know about.

This repo is here to collect the most important content from the industry in a cheat sheet. Each entry in the sheet should provide a clear "why should we do this" and avoid platitudes. Detailed explanations cannot be provided in the sheet however and will be confined to written form inside this repo.

Is this cheat sheet opinionated? Yes, especially when we get down to style. I don't see a way around that though, without opinions we would agree in the abstract but fail in the specific.
